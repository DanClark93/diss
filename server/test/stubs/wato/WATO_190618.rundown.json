We'll bring that to you when it happens.\nBut a Home Office spokesperson said any discussion about the use of cannabis-based medicines would not extend to its recreational use. \nMr Hague based his argument around the case of Billy Caldwell, the 12 year old with epilepsy who was admitted to hospital after his medical cannabis oil was confiscated. He said it showed the government's approach was out of date. The Home Office have granted him a limited licence for the drug to be administered in hospital for 20 days.\nHannah Deacon has a 6-year old son, Alfie , who suffers from the same illness as Billy Caldwell. He had the treatment in Holland but the family had to return to the UK when they ran out of funds. She says she met Theresa May in 10 Downing Street in March: \nShe said she felt played by the government. \nWe asked the Government to respond to Hannah Deacon and they directed us to comments made by the Policing Minister Nick Hurd in the House of Commons yesterday. He said that the process had to be clinically led and that it was firmly on track. He said that he hoped to make a positive decision as soon as possible. \nShadow Transport Minister Andy McDonald lost his son after an epileptic seizure and says he understands from a parent's perspective the experience of trying to find the right treatment.\nOn comments made by William Hague: \nA Home Office Spokesperson said:\n\"There is strong scientific and medical evidence that cannabis is a harmful drug which can harm people's mental and physical health and can damage communities. The Government is clear - we must prevent drug use in our communities and help those dependent on drugs to recover, while ensuring our drugs laws are enforced\n\"The Government has no intention of reviewing the classification of cannabis and it will remain a class B drug. Classification is completely separate to scheduling regulations.\n\"Any debate within government about the efficacy and therapeutic use of cannabis based medicines emphatically does not extend to any review regarding the classification of cannabis and the penalties for the illicit possession, cultivation and trafficking of cannabis will remain the same.\""

The watchdog the Financial Reporting Council singled out the company as the worst of the \"big four\" accountants but says the audit profession overall is in decline. The FRC is already investigating KPMG over its role in the collapse of Carillion, and warned that the deterioration in the quality of its work was unacceptable. The big four - PWC, KPMG, EY and Deloitte - between them audit more than 90% of all big company accounts.\nThe Labour MP Frank Field is chair of parliament's work and pensions select committee.\nFRANK FIELD SAYS:\n*big four definitely need to be broken up\n*when you look at all the big scandals in recent years you'll see one of the big four involved making some money.\nthe main points I would wish to make:\n1.       The question to the Big Four is, why shouldn't you be broken up?\n2.       The question to the FRC is, what moves will you initiate to make it easier for other firms to get in and compete ?\n3.       Shouldn't the FRC consider breaking up the audit work from the more lucrative consultancy work? \nSpoken to office - likely available but asked to email. \nEmail sent to fieldf@parliament.uk\nAndrew Tyrie \n07789 431 212\nNO ANSWER - TEXTED\nSIMON JACK PIECE FROM LAST YEAR:\nWhat are auditors for?\nSimon Jack\nBusiness editor\n4 May 2017\n30 comments Share this with Facebook  Share this with Twitter  Share this with Messenger  Share this with Email  Share\nRolls-Royce factoryImage copyrightGETTY IMAGES\nMore from Simon\nRBS court case adjourned for third time\nMay's social care pledge could be huge wealth tax\nScreaming into the void\nLloyds settles taxpayer tab\nIt was perhaps inevitable that after Rolls Royce was hit with the biggest fine in the history of the Serious Fraud Office, attention would turn to who else knew about the murky goings on at the engine maker.\nEarlier this year Rolls-Royce paid a total of £671m in fines  and apologised after it was found to have paid millions in bribes over decades to middlemen to secure orders.\nThe Financial Reporting Council has said it is starting an investigation into the role of its long time auditor, KPMG who had been poring over Rolls Royce's accounts for 26 years. Given they were charged with giving the company's accounts a clean bill of health - how come they didn't spot something was wrong?\nKPMG said it was co-operating and was \"confident in the quality\" of its work but surely, a detailed and professional audit should have turned up this widespread, recurrent and illegal activity? If it didn't what the hell are auditors for anyway?\nScandals like the one at Rolls-Royce  serve to illustrate the structural problems at the heart of auditing and financial oversight.\nThe first is that auditors are not the police or regulators. They don't arrive and cart off whichever documents they like. By and large, they have to work with the information the company CHOOSES to give them. It is pretty easy for a company determined to pull the wool over the eyes of the auditor to do just that. This is the defence usually trotted out by audit firms.\nThe second is that auditors are contractors who are paid by the companies they examine.\n'Time to get cosy'\nThe big four  between them audit over 90% of all big company accounts. They compete with each other for this lucrative business and it's in their interests to curry favour with the people who employ and pay them. KPMG have audited Rolls Royce for 26 years over which time they have been paid tens of millions of pounds and will inevitably develop a close relationship. Likewise, PwC audited Tesco for 32 years before agreeing not to re tender for the business in the wake of the accounting scandal.\nNot an ideal backdrop for taking a tough, arms-length view of a company's activities. While conscious corruption is rare, it would be unsurprising if unconscious bias in favour of the company paying you didn't creep in over decades of lucrative association.\nRecent new rules mean that big public companies  now have to put their auditing contract up for tender every ten years but are only forced to change every twenty. That's still plenty of time to get cosy.\nAuditors do get fined from time to time. The record fine in the US is $8m and the UK record is £3m pounds. These are tiny sums compared to both the fines levied on companies that misbehave and the huge size of the big accounting firms.\nThe major accountancy firms have historically made big rewards for relatively little risk."

Not ideal. Think there is a real need for a change - and we have ideas as to what could be done.\nThere's a lot of scrutiny at the moment, with CMA review expected.\nKey message is that it's absolutely vital that there is trust and confidence in audit, and if that is undermined, it damages all of the very good audits that happen all the time. The good ones are put at risk when trust is undermined. This is a watershed moment and need to get it right.\nSuspect Michael will say we need to concentrate on what we're trying to solve - if the question is about choice and competition, then no option off the table.

Also, think that even if you do want to improve competition, break up not necessariyl the best choice. Partly because the next tier down isn't entering this market. If that is because people aren't sure the business is worth it, then if you break up the big four what's to say the smaller firms then won't engage?\nBetter to make the market more attractive to more people, not make it more difficult for the firms already involved.

Regarding refugee numbers - Grandi is correct about possibilities of distribution, bearing in mind overwhelmingly refugees are based in the Global South.\n2. The situation in the USA is unprecedented for a number of reasons;\ni never have children been separated and incarcerated - in cages. Even with the detention of Japanese Americans, children were with their parents;\nii there is no constitutional basis for this - no instruction from a court; this is coming from the Attorney General and US President.\niii the US public overwhelmingly disapproves\n3. Regarding public opinion - as I argue in my article, political leaders are out of sync with their publics. We saw this in Italy last week with several mayors offering to take in the migrants on board the Aquarius; the Pew Charitable Trust, European Social Survey and others all show greater sympathy for refugees. Certainly there's no support for leaving people at sea.\nI am a US national so I feel strongly about this\nI have looked at public opinion data -  politicians believe there is anti-immigrant view among population - but this is wrong -  they are out of touch with the public.\nPoliticians don't look at the data - it is an ideological view.\nThe public will come out and say they want to reduce immigration - however, they don't believe attitudes towards refugees are how they feel, they want them to be treated properly.\nObama refused something like 3m people into the country. He isn't weak. So when Trump talks about the US becoming a migrant camp, and being hard line, it is wrong.\nSeparating children from parents from children - this is the new low and it could be a turning point.\nThe problem is that in the US there are lies from US officials, blaming congress, and it's tragic. \nThere is an agreement between Trump and attorney general towards a zero-tolerance policy. Then Homeland Security comes out at says there is no zero-tolerance. It is chaos\nJULIAN SAYS:\nWe need to talk about the numbers. The interior ministry on the weekend talked about perceived and actual perception of loss of control\nThe organisation that collects information about refugees says that the numbers have done down. Yesterday statistical office - Eurostat - press release, chief of Easo also said refugee figures gone down in the European Union\nAnd yet we are in this crisis with the interior minister - who is threatening to strike out and start border checks.\nThese numbers are interesting - there is too much frenzy going on for the numbers to go into policy.\nIn the German case - the CSU and the interior minister, are under huge pressure - and are used to having a majority in Bavaria, and the interior minister has been portrayed as shouting loud but not actually doing anything.\nBut this pressure is dangerous - they are tainting the picture-  about loss of  control, about how the law is not applied.
