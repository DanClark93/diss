An independent report, which has just been published, says there were shortcomings in the Church's Past Cases Review -- which examined clergy files dating back over three decades. Sir Roger Singleton, who wrote today's report, said the Church's review did not give a full picture of the problem. However, he said he found no evidence of a deliberate attempt to mislead, nor any suggestion that anyone had broken the law."

    "script": "The pan european firm Airbus does not pull its punches. The company which employs 14 thousand people in the UK, and gives work to more than a hundred thousand more, says a 'no deal Brexit' would be 'catastrophic' - severely disrupting production, costing the company billions of pounds, and leading them to reconsidering their  position in this country.  They say this is not Project Fear but dawning reality.  Today the German industry confederation the BDI warned the UK is heading for 'a disorderly Brexit with no brakes'. This follows European Commission President Jean Claude Junker's words in Dublin. He began by saying: \"with pragmatism comes realism.\"\n\"As the clock to Brexit ticks down, we must prepare for every eventuality, including no deal. This is neither a desired nor a likely outcome. But it is not an impossible one. And we are getting ready just in case\"\nBut Airbus are not sanguine about even a full deal with the EU. They say the transition period ending in 2020 is too short to agree all the details. When there are new rules it would potentially mean higher complexity, more effort, more costs, more risks and more delay.That means that they will 'carefully monitor' any new investment in the UK and will 'refrain from extending its UK suppliers and partners.
