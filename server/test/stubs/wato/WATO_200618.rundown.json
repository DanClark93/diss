The report into suspicious deaths at the Gosport War Memorial hospital between 1989 and 2000 - says the practise resulted in more than 450 patients' lives being shortened. The independent panel says families who raised concerns were consistently let down by those in authority. In conclusion - it talks of \"missed opportunities\", with early warnings going \"unheeded\".  Our correspondent, Richard Lister, is in Portsmouth - where the findings have been published:"

The headmaster, Gregg Davies, said there had been a significant difference in pupil behaviour since the policy was rolled out at the start of the year.\nDavies said the school was clear that the mobile phone can be a \"brilliant tool\" in the classroom, particularly because it's easier to carry around than a laptop. \"But phones were vibrating when a text came in or an Instagram. It was distracting the learning.\"\nStudents at Shiplake can carry phones on them if they are not seen, but most put them in lockers because they say the temptation is too great. \"One of our biggest sayings is 'choice, risk, consequence'. So yes they can carry their phones round, that's their choice, but if they take it out they risk being caught.\"\nInitially, most pupils were against the ban, but six months on two-thirds prefer it, Davies said.\nJO SAYS:\nMy school - regularly use mobiles\nCan be a pain - but in the right way it is perfect\nI am a science teacher - so we can use it as a timer,\nWe can use WIFI and that helps students access school resources.\nSecondary school teacher in Reading.\nThe problem is you are taking away a massive resource\nIt is important to show pupils that the internet is an education tool - I don't think it is right that teachers tell pupils how they should use their mobile phones - other than for behaviour.\nBRIEF:\nChildren should have mobile phones confiscated at the start of the school day, according to Matt Hancock, the Culture Secretary, who will warn on Wednesday of the \"risks\" social media can present.\nWriting in The Daily Telegraph, Matt Hancock suggests more head teachers should \"follow the lead\" of colleagues who ban phones during school hours because the devices can have a \"real impact\" on academic achievement.\nAs well as being a distraction, mobiles expose children to cyber-bullying, Mr Hancock says, as he questions why pupils need to have phones at all.\nHIS SPEECH TODAY:\nWe rightly use our education system to help our children understand face-to-face relationships and what it means to be a citizen.\nIt is vital that we update these frameworks to reflect the new challenges of the digital age, and to reflect what it means to be a digital citizen.\nTo help them understand what behaviours are acceptable online and how they can contribute positively to the online world.\nAnd also to help them understand online risks and know how to seek help if they need it.\nI am the biggest supporter of edtech. I kicked off a project at DfE to drive the uptake of technology in the classroom for teaching.\nBut while I bow to nobody in my support of technology, we also need students to know how to stay safe.\nWhilst it is up to individual schools to decide rather than Government, I admire the many headteachers who take a firm approach and do not allow mobiles to be used during the school day.\nA high performing comprehensive school not far from here is ranked as Outstanding by Ofsted.\nAnd their policy on mobile phones says \"We are convinced that mobile phones are a distraction and have serious concerns about the impact of their inappropriate use. We know their use is reducing our students' ability to connect with one another socially on a day-to-day basis.\"\nA recent study by The Journal of the Association for Consumer Research has shown that mobile phones can have a real impact on working memory and measured intelligence, even if the phone is on a table or in a bag.\nI encourage other schools to look at the evidence and follow their lead.\nINFO:\nThe debate about access to mobile phones in schools is ongoing in the UK, where more than 90% of teenagers have mobiles. A recent study by the London School of Economics found that in schools where mobiles were banned, the test scores of 16-year-olds improved by 6.4% - the equivalent of adding five days to the school year, economists reckon. \nGUEST: Dr Jo Toovey\nTITLE: Head of Health and Social care at a school in Reading - and also a Science teacher\nTECHS: LIVE EX TEL\nCONTACT: 07740 402226\nSAYS:\nMy school - regularly use schools\nCan be a pain - but in the right way it is perfect\nI am a science teacher - so we can use it as a timer\nWe can use WIFI and that helps students access school resources.\nSecondary school teacher in Reading.\nThe problem is you are taking away a massive resource\nIt is important to show pupils that the internet is an education tool - I don't think it is right that teachers tell pupils how they should use their mobile phones - other than for behaviour.\nNOTRE DAME SCHOOL\nhttp:/www.ndhs.org.uk/page/default.asp?title=Home&pid=1\nGUEST: Kathryn James ** answerphone\nTITLE: Deputy General Secretary of the School leaders' union  National Association of Head Teachers\nTECHS: LIVE EX TEL\nCONTACT: 07968 587116\nGUEST: Dr Zenna Hopson - NO ANSWER\nTITLE: Former Chair of Ofsted and current education consultant\nCONTACT: 07792696551\n**former teacher**\nGUEST: Lorrae Jaderberg  - NOT HER\nTITLE: Co-managing Director of jaderbergkrais  - an educational consultancy\nTECHS: LIVE EX TEL\nCONTACT: 02083710050\nBU: 07778 068 260\nFormer secondary school teacher\nGUEST AND TITLE: Kim Knappett - NO\nTITLE: President of The Association of Teachers and Lecturers\nCONTACT: 07986082553 \nSCHOOL BAN\nShiplake College, independent, Henley-on-Thames.\nAny pupil caught with a mobile phone on them between 8.15am and 5.45pm is given a detention.
