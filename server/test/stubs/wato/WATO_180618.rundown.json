Also need to raise NI by 1% \n+ His report  aims to examine the state of quality in health and care services on the NHS's 70th birthday and make recommendations for future funding and reform of the system. Launched in December 2017, the Lord Darzi Review is aiming to:\n1. Examine the quality - meaning safety, effectiveness, timeliness, efficiency and equitability - of care in the NHS and social care service today.\n2. Establish the funding settlement and reforms needed to drive improvements in the quality of care in the coming decade. \n2018 is a year of anniversaries: 70 years since the NHS was created as part of the post-second world war social settlement; 50 years since the Seebohm Report which laid the foundations for modern social care; and 10 years since High Quality Care for All was published with its sharper focus on quality of health and care. It is therefore the perfect moment to stand back and reflect on the progress that has been made, as well as the challenges that we have faced. We must also look to the future: high quality care is a constantly moving target so to stand still is to fall back.\nThis interim report of the Lord Darzi Review of Health presents this evidence in preparation for the final report which will be published in the lead up to 70th anniversary of the NHS and will set out a long term funding and reform plan for health and care. \nThe slide pack sets out all of the analysis undertaken by Carnall Farrar and IPPR for the Lord Darzi Review of health and care including on population health, access, quality and funding. \nLORD DARZI REPORT for IPPR \nNHS surgeon and former health minister, Lord Darzi published an interim report which says that the NHS bill is set to rise by more than £50bn by 2030.\nconclusions: \n\"We have demonstrated that the health and care system will need up to an additional £60bn p.a. by 2030. More money may seem unachievable but it is far from impossible. Governments must stop approaching the NHS and social care as a liability to be managed and instead look at it as investment that delivers a return\"\nThe interim report is clear that the pressures that the systems have faced over the last decade, will continue for the next 10 years. It says that, 'We are entering a period of profound disruption - both exciting and challenging - for the NHS and social care system. Some have argued that our \"free at the point of need\" system is unsustainable in this context: but it is a fundamental error of logic to say that something is unaffordable, so we should move to something more expensive.'\nIt goes on to say, 'That's why we must reaffirm the founding principles of the NHS, committing to a long term funding settlement and a reform plan, and take time to consider what this means for the future of social care, which for too long has been sidelined in the funding and reform debate.'"
