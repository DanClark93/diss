{"story":"Q Brexit May","script":"Theresa May has been forced to defend her approach to the Brexit negotiations - after one of her most senior cabinet colleagues said the government lacked guts in its talks with the EU.   The Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, was recorded suggesting to Conservative supporters that President Trump could do a better job.   Downing Street said the Prime Minister had confidence in Mr Johnson;  this afternoon she told the BBC the negotiations were complex and people like him had strong views on Brexit.

{"story":"Q Brexit EU","script":"The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has questioned Mrs May's proposal for future customs arrangements - which was agreed yesterday after intense negotiations to overcome disagreement at the heart of the government.  Mrs May has envisaged a temporary arrangement -- with the UK remaining closely aligned to the single market -- in the event of no deal. Yesterday she said it would remain in force until December 2021 at the latest to avoid a hard Irish border. But Mr Barnier said the EU's so-called  backstop solution could apply only to Northern Ireland. From Brussels, our Europe correspondent, Kevin Connolly, reports:"},

Our reporter, Simon Jones, has spent the day at the scene:\nAs officers continue to search Iris Warner's home, she remains in hospital - in pain and confused about what happened.  The great-grandmother has been able to tell police that she woke up in bed to find a man standing over her.  He hit her repeatedly on her head, then he ransacked her room.  She was found drifting in and out of consciousness by her son on Monday, but police believe she may have been lying injured, unable to summon help, for up to two days.  Detective Inspector Saj Hussein from the Metropolitan Police was shocked at what he said was a terrifying attack on a defenceless pensioner:\n\"I've not seen another attack like this in my 17 years of policing.  This was a horrific assault.\nShe has multiple injuries and 2 bleeds to the brain. I am worried that the individual is still out there.\"\nIris Warner's son, Jeffrey, said he was stunned and sickened by the attack.  He released pictures of his mother in hospital, black and blue with bruises all over her body, to encourage anyone with information to come forward.  Neighbours who've seen the photos, like Prashant Patel, are struggling to comprehend what's happened:\n\"She's a local so she used to go down to the sweet shop and buy a newspaper. I used to see her almost every other day. I'm just shocked. It's the most disgusting, terrible thing. I'm horrified.\"\nPolice are stressing that crimes of this nature are incredibly rare and are asking people not to panic.

{"story":"Q Winter break","script":"The Premier League is to introduce a winter break.  It's intended to give players a rest and reduce the number of injuries.  Our sports reporter, Jo Currie, has more details:\nAfter years of lobbying by managers - the Premier League is falling into line with other top European Leagues by introducing a two-week mid-season break.  IT which will take place in February - starting in the season after next.\nHowever, THE BREAK'S being structured in a SUCH A way so that SOME Premier league matches continue during that time.\nFive games, INSTEAD OF THE USUAL 10, will take place on the first weekend, and five on the following weekend - effectively SO different clubs will be given a rest at different timeS during the break.\nTo help make it possible - FA Cup 5th Round matches will be moved to mid-week and replays will be scrapped.\nThe Chief executive of the FA Martin Glenn has hailed it a 'significant' move which will 'greatly benefit club and country'. \nBut whilst the Premier League players will be given a rest, it'll be business as usual for the remainder of the football league - with their programme of fixtures set to continue as normal.\nFA AND PREMIER LEAGUE AGREE ON TWO-WEEK MID-SEASON BREAK FROM 2019-20\nBy Matt Slater, Press Association Chief Sports Reporter\nThe Football Association has announced a deal with the Premier League to\nintroduce a mid-season break in February from the 2019-20 season onward.\nAfter years of deadlock on the issue, the FA and the league have finally found\na compromise that should give players more rest without upsetting the\nbroadcasters and sponsors too much.\nTo make room for the two-week break, the FA Cup's fifth-round ties will be\nplayed midweek and will be settled on the night, while a round of Premier League\nfixtures will be played over two weekends, with five games one weekend and five\nthe next.\nThe break will only apply to the Premier League, though, with a full English\nFootball League programme continuing over the break.\nIn a statement, EFL chief executive Shaun Harvey said he supported the creation\nof a break for the top flight but \"it is currently impractical even if it was\ndesirable for the EFL\" to do likewise because of the scheduling challenges of\nplaying 46-game seasons and play-offs.\nWhile some may be disappointed about the loss of replays in the FA Cup's fifth\nround and the EFL's failure to find room to give its players some rest, the fact\nthe FA and Premier League have managed to find an answer to one of English\nfootball's oldest debates should be welcomed.\nThe FA's chief executive Martin Glenn said: \"This is a significant moment for\nEnglish football and one we believe will greatly benefit both club and country.\n\"It's no secret that we have a very congested fixture calendar and over recent\nyears we have been working with the whole game to find a solution.\n\"Today's announcement proves that football can come together for the good of\nthe game. We have also found a way to give the players a much needed mid-season\nbreak, whilst keeping the much-loved Christmas schedule in place.\"\nThe deal is also another box ticked for Premier League executive chairman\nRichard Scudamore, who stunned the game on Thursday by announcing his decision\nto step down later this year after nearly two decades in the job.\n\"We have been discussing the football calendar with the FA and EFL for several\nmonths, including ways we can work together to ease fixture congestion, keep the\nPremier League action going right through the season and provide a mid-season\nplayer break,\" Scudamore said.\n\"We are very pleased to have an outcome that will include an exciting first\nfor fans - a full fixture programme split over two weekends with all matches\nbroadcast live in the UK.\"\nThat last point is a reference to another of the deals he has announced in the\nlast 24 hours: the sale of the remaining UK broadcast rights for 2019-22, with\nBT buying a package which will allow it to show all five games from one of the\nsplit weekends, while Sky shows the games from the other.\nThe FA is also hoping its recent broadcast deals will smooth over any\nopposition from clubs upset about FA Cup replays disappearing in another round\nof the competition, as the prize fund for the competition is set to double from\nnext season.\nThe news might have come too late to help England manager Gareth Southgate in\nthis summer's World Cup but it does come on the same day as a call from world\nfootballers' union FIFPro for minimum mid-season breaks of 10 days, more rest\nbetween games and much longer off-season breaks.\nThere is clearly much more conversation to be had to achieve those last two\naims, and critics will note the English break will still be shorter than all the\nother major European leagues' breaks, but England managers, FA executives,\nplayers and the owners of warm-weather training centres will not be complaining\ntoo loudly today.\n081315 JUN 18"},
