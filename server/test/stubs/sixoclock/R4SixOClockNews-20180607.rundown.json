This is Alan Smith Good evening.\nThe government has published its \"backstop\" plan for trade with the EU after Brexit but only after the inclusion of an \"expected\" end date of 2021.

{"story":"Q Brexit 1","script":"After 24 hours of heightened political drama -- in which the Brexit secretary, David Davis, had threatened to quit -- the government has published its fallback plan to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland.  Theresa May held a series of one-to-one meetings with senior cabinet colleagues to ensure their support.  The prime minister told reporters the important thing was that a policy had been agreed.  Ministers decided that if no permanent customs deal is agreed before Brexit, a temporary arrangement should not remain beyond December 2021.  But the EU has already cast doubt on the backstop proposal.  Our first report is from our assistant political editor, Norman Smith:"},
{"story":"Q Brexit 2","script":"The policy produced by the intense political bargaining at Westminster has received a cool response in Brussels.  The European Union's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said any proposal needed to be realistic and workable.  The European parliament's Brexit chief, Guy Verhofstadt, said it was difficult to see how it could provide a workable solution.   On the island of Ireland itself, the UK's plan to avoid a hard border has drawn contrasting responses.  Here's our Ireland correspondent, Chris Page:"},
{"story":"Q House of Fraser 1","script":"The chief executive of House of Fraser has acknowledged that its restructuring plans, which will see 31 of its 59 stores close, are \"brutal\". Alex Williamson told the BBC that it had been a tough decision and \"very dramatic\" for the six thousand people whose jobs are now at risk.  If its landlords approve the plan later this month, a new Chinese owner is expected to acquire the company and make a significant investment. The news of the closures has come as a surprise to many. Our correspondent Phil Mackie has spent the day at one of the company's stores in Wolverhampton:\nBeatties has been a famous name in Wolverhampton ever since draper James Beattie opened his first store in the city centre in 1877. House of Fraser took it over 13 years ago but it still operates under its historic name. News that it'll shut next year was greeted with dismay by shoppers\n\" I shopped here all my life so I'm really sad that it's closing. There's nothing else, is there in Wolverhampton. It's only this shop.\nA bsolutely gutted, we'll lose jobs, it's  going to be missed a lot.\nStaggered I've been coming here, my grandmother used to bring me when I was 3. I'm 90 now. I'm very shocked\"\n279 staff work here - either directly employed by House of Fraser or working in one of its concessions. It's another big blow to Wolverhampton, only four months after the collapse of Carillion which was based in the city. The council has held an emergency meeting. John Reynolds is the cabinet member responsible for the city's economy\n\"what we talked about this morning is looking what we can do with partners to make sure we can find people other job opportunities in retail. And if people in retail have transferable skills, we'll look at trying to find them opportunities in leisure as well\"\nIt's hard to see another store moving into such a large site, which means it's more likely it'll be redeveloped or split into smaller units. And - as spending habits continue to change - it may no longer have a retail future at all"},
{"story":"Q House of Fraser 2","script":"In recent months a number of other high-street retailers have either announced store closures or gone into administration.

{"story":"Q Abortion","script":"The Government is facing growing pressure to reform abortion laws in Northern Ireland after the Supreme Court said they were not compatible with human rights. Pro-choice campaigners had argued that the ban on terminations in cases of rape, incest or foetal abnormality was in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights. But, as our Ireland correspondent Emma Vardy reports, the Supreme Court judges rejected the case on a legal technicality: \nHuman rights campaigners have lost a Supreme Court appeal over the legality of Northern Ireland's abortion law on a technical issue. But judges at the UK's highest court said they believe the current law on abortion in Northern Ireland is incompatible with human rights. The remarks are likely to increase the pressure on the government to consider a change in the law. From the Supreme Court, here's our Ireland Correspondent, Emma Vardy\nThe UK's most senior judges spoke of their sympathy for women in Northern Ireland who have had to travel to in difficult circumstances England to access abortions. \nNorthern Ireland is the only part of the UK where there remains a near-ban on terminations, except in limited circumstances where there is a serious risk to the mother's health. \nThe legal challenge by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission failed today on the technical grounds that the commission did not have the power to bring these proceedings.\nBut the supreme court made it clear, if an individual victim had brought this case in relation to the current law, it WOULD have ruled that Northern Ireland's Abortion Law is incompatible with the European Convention of Human Rights\nBARONESS HALE OF RICHMOND, The PRESIDENT OF THE SUPREME COURT delivered the judgement this morning:\nCLIP on the preliminary issue a majority of the court are agreed that the Commission does not have the standing to bring these proceedings it follows that the court has no jurisdiction to make a declaration that the law is incompatible even though a  majority of the court are clear that it is\nA majority of judges on the supreme court panel concluded that the current law in Northern Ireland which prevents abortions in cases of rape, incest, and fatal foetal abnormalities is in breach of a woman's human rights.\nAn abortion reform campaigner Sarah Ewart who was at the hearing, welcomed the judges comments. She herself previously travelled to England for an abortion, after she was told her unborn baby had a fatal condition.\nCLIP Extremely relieved and just wanted to thank the judges of the Supreme Court for recognising that there's been a breach of human rights for women who go through the situation of fatal foetal abnormality and there's been a loud and clear today that the law needs to be changed \nIn the absence of the Northern Ireland assembly, which collapsed 17 months ago, there have been growing cross party calls at westminster for the government to act. \nThe judges remarks are not legally binding but will add weight to the political arguments of MPs at Westminster who believe the government should now leglisate to change the law on Northern Ireland's behalf.\nBut anti-abortion campaigner, Peter Lynas from the group Both Lives Matter, said it should remain a matter for Stormont.\nCLIP NI Assembly ruled on this in Feb 2016  it's not like we haven't discussed it locally and dealt with all the facts NI has ruled on it its a devolved matter Westminster shouldn't be interfering and the court has gone as far as it can at this moment \nBut Lord Kerr, Justice of the surpreme court had a clear message for Westminster.  He said while the judges remarks are not binding, they must nevertheless be worthy of close consideration by those in whose power it lies to decide whether the law should be altered."},
{"story":"Q Grenfell","script":"Police investigating the Grenfell Tower fire are to consider whether the advice given to residents on the night of the blaze broke any laws.  Scotland Yard says it will examine the so-called \"stay-put\" strategy as part of its wider inquiry -- to try to establish if any health and safety offences were committed.

{"story":"Q Transgender","script":"A baby could become the first person born in England or Wales who will not legally have a mother, if a transgender man wins a historic case in the High Court. The child's parent underwent gender re-assignment after giving birth. He argues that forcing him to register as the child's mother, breaches his human rights. Our correspondent Tom Burridge has been looking at the case: \nThe question at the heart of this case is whether someone who gives birth to a baby, can only be recognised, legally, as a woman. The transgender man, challenging that principle argues he was biologically able to get pregnant and give birth, but had already legally become a man, by the time his baby was born. When he went to register his baby's birth, he was told that because he gave birth, he had to be registered as the baby's mother, when in fact he wants to be identified as the child's father, or simply as a parent. He says that is a breach of his human rights. Lawyers say that if the man wins his fight, the baby - which was at today's hearing at the High Court - will be the first person born in England or Wales not to legally have a mother."},

{"story":"Q Terror","script":"The Old Bailey has heard that a heavily armed man who was arrested in Whitehall last April, later told police that he was a \"Mujahid\" who'd been fighting Western troops in Afghanistan. On the day of his arrest, Khalid Ali had insisted that he was in Westminster to bring a message to British leaders, and that he had no plans to attack anyone. Our Home Affairs Correspondent Daniel Sandford was in court: \nA man arrested carrying three knives in Whitehall in April last year told police afterwards that he was a \"Mujahid\" who had been fighting Western troops in Afghanistan\nBut Khalid Ali insisted that on the day of his arrest he was only in Westminster to bring a message to British leaders, and said he had no plans to attack anyone.\nOur Home Affairs Correspondent Daniel Sandford reports from the fourth day of his trial at the Old Bailey.\nThe day's hearing began with the jury watching close-up video footage of Khalid Ali being arrested by heavily armed police, who then removed three knives from his pockets and waistband. \nThe jury then heard that in interviews after his arrest he told officers he had been in Westminster to deliver a message to what he called \"the hierarchy\", but that the knives were only to defend himself.\nThen on the sixth day of questioning - he suddenly declared that he was a Mujahid who had fought with the Taliban against Western troops in Afghanistan.
