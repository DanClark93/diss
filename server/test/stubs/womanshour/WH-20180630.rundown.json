For the past two years, it's been hearing from hundreds of people who have come forward to share their stories of abuse. They range in age from 95 to 21. Some of their accounts were published this week: for the first time we have some idea of the scale of the problem. Not just in institutions like the church or the scout movement or the BBC, but much more frequently in families.  Here is Sabah's story. Now in her forties, she came to the Truth Project after hearing about it on the news"

A Comres poll for Woman's Hour suggests about three quarters of women are willing to take some form of action for a cause in which they believe, but in the past year just a quarter of us has done something. And then they're more likely to contribute to an online campaign than a protest, a march or flouting the law.  Harriet Mackenzie Williams campaigns against fracking. Grace Campbell is one of the founders of the Pink Protest and Mary Barton is an animal welfare and rights campaigner – what inspires her to get out and do something?"

He has denied the allegations and the Japanese judicial system has dismissed the case. Unusually, Shiori Ito has spoken in public about what she believes happened. Allegations of rape are rare in Japan – only 1 out of a 100,000 report a rape. In the UK it's 51 in a 100,000. Shiori is now in the process of bringing a private prosecution. She told Jenni the police reaction was to her initial report"
