In today's programme the German Chancellor Angela Merkel survives another challenge to her leadership – after nearly thirteen years in power what could other women leaders learn from her stickability? As Woman's Hour prepares for a musical power list in 2018, what about the up and coming singer songwriters – how are they coping with the industry? And the NHS at 70 – what's been the impact of budget cuts on the services we all took for granted?"

            "script": "Across the week we've been analysing the state of the NHS as it celebrates its seventieth birthday. What's changed on the wards of our hospitals and in the teams of the people who work on them?  Eileen and Sacha are both nurses: but their experience is 50 years apart.  Eileen began her training in 1948, while Sacha finished hers last week.  What made Eileen want to be a nurse?"

            "script": "On Thursday Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor for nearly thirteen years, met Theresa May, the British Prime Minister for two years. They met in Berlin to discuss Brexit. It's not an easy time for either woman, but Angela Merkel has this week fought off another challenge to her leadership – she beats Margaret Thatcher who lasted for only eleven years. Merkel made a deal with her coalition partner to toughen Germany's immigration policy. It's generally the case that women leaders are more likely to stand down or be ousted than men, so what does Angela Merkel have that others haven't when it comes to stickability  Stephanie Bolzen is the London correspondent for Die Welt.  Anne McElvoy is senior editor at the Economist. How has  Merkel survived again?"

            "script": "You may remember five years ago a terrible attack that happened in Zanzibar. Katie Gee and Kirstie Trup were eighteen years old and coming to the end of their gap year. They were celebrating their last night when two men drove up on a moped and threw acid at them. Katie was left with 30 per cent burns on her body and lost her ear and Kirstie needed skin grafts on her face, arm and shoulder. She told Jane what she recalls of that day."

            "script": "Anne Tyler is famous for a lot of things – not the least of which is her reluctance to give interviews about her work. She's a novelist, a mistress of the short story form and probably best known for The Accidental Tourist. There are 20 novels and the latest, Clock Dance, has had rave reviews and she agreed to talk to us about it. She was persuaded to go into a studio in Baltimore, the place she has called home for more than 50 years. She spoke to Jane about her central character,  a conventional woman called Willa Drake … we first meet her at the age of 11 and then see her at 21, 41 and 61. Anne talked first about Willa's parents' relationship and the impact it had on her."

We know there are some great woman song writers – Kate Bush, Taylor Swift or Madonna to name just a couple, but it's often the case that women sing songs by men and their image and careers are controlled by male executives. So how do the new young women who write songs get themselves known? Madison Paris and Svetlana Onye both write songs for themselves and for other artists. What is the pleasure of writing your own song for yourself?"

Deborah Alma has taken things a step further. She calls herself the Emergency Poet, owns a 1970s ambulance and travels to festivals, schools, libraries and hospitals to read poems to those in need. She also has a new collection of her own work – Dirty Laundry. How did she become the Emergency Poet?"
