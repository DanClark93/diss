The second trimester is when the woman is said to be at her glowing best. The third is when you feel you have a football in your stomach and you can't turn over at night. And then, apparently, there's a fourth trimester. It's the three months after the baby is born.

Dr Dominic Willmott, a forensic psychologist from the University of Huddersfield and a Manchester based barrister, Nigel Booth, were interested in why juries in rape cases are still persistently more likely to deliver not guilty verdicts. They created a series of trials, as faithful to the real thing as possible, to find out what was going on. After three years and some 500 surveys they think they've found the problem. So what is it? And what could we do about it?  What have they discovered are the myths about rape that can influence a jury? Dr Dominic Willmot."
