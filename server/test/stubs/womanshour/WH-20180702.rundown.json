Secret Barrister Easy for the lucky ones to demonise the poor people in the dock -' they' aren't like 'us' – part of your project to humanise the people who wind up in court??? NB we would get a fair trial….  You imagine yourself into the mind of the protagonists. First page .Dominic felt...'  – why? (Dangerous to blur the boundaries between fact and fiction?? though she has blurred identifying details) The cases of the women Saba and Rita and Maggie – their problems arise from being wives and mothers…..  Maggie's story. Born into cycles of abuse and neglect, first child taken into care and but for a judge prepared to take a risk she might have lost many more. Something we have covered on WH.  (Changes to legal aid in 2013 mean that many people represent themselves in court – in some of the cases you write about this would have been disastrous for those involved?? Saba for eg For Podcast???) Do you think you could tell by reading a judgment whether the judge was male or female?  Is the legal profession due a #MeToo moment?  We know about locker room banter – what about robing room banter??  You are technically on maternity leave (*though as a freelancer there is no such thing for barristers) are motherhood and being a barrister simply incompatible? (freelance culture and no protection) What impact, if any, does women leaving the Bar have on the decisions made in court?"

Perhaps the secret is around the paternity of your children, or a sibling you didn't know you had. Maybe you discovered something you had always sensed about your family's past, or were asked to keep a secret hidden from other family members?"
