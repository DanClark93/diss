Partly explained by Serena Williams taking a year off to have a baby. Why are women relatively so under paid and what's being done about a clear gender pay gap?  Natasha Jonas is a professional boxer and Anna Kessel is a sports writer and founder and chair of Women in Football. Was she surprised to find that not a single woman made the list?"
