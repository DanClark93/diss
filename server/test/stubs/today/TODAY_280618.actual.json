    "script": "Now, time for a look at today's papers and news websites.    \nAccording to the TIMES, Britain fears that President Trump will undermine Nato by striking a \"peace deal\" with President Putin at their summit next month.  Cabinet ministers, it says, are worried that Mr Trump may be persuaded to downgrade US military commitments in Europe and even cancel military exercises -- replicating his agreement with Kim Jong-un of North Korea.  Writing in the GUARDIAN, Martin Kettle says Europeans must ask themselves the question: has Trump's US become a hostile power?\nTony Blair's call for Brexit to be delayed has sparked \"fury\", according to the DAILY EXPRESS, which calls his comments \"highly inflammatory\".  The DAILY TELEGRAPH calls him \"the meddlesome Mr Blair\", and says he should use his influence in Brussels to defend his country's interests, not undermine them.  The Business Secretary, Greg Clark, gets roughed up by the SUN for -- in its view -- lobbying for the softest of soft Brexits.  It accuses Mr Clark of tugging his forelock to big businesses that have done very well out of the EU for years.  The SUN tells the prime minister it's time she backed Brexit voters over corporate doom-mongers.  \nIn an interview with the FINANCIAL TIMES, the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, says he's ready to strike a deal with Angela Merkel to make it easier for Germany to send asylum seekers back to other European countries.  The FT says such an agreement would be an important boost for Mrs Merkel, who is under intense pressure from her coalition partners to speed up return procedures for migrants already registered in other EU countries. \nThe TIMES says it has learnt that Chinese railway companies are the frontrunners to operate the trains on the new HS2 high speed line.  Sources have told the paper that China is on course to win because rival British-led bidders are beset by crises and unwilling to take on the financial risk.  \nTHE DAILY MIRROR, and others, report that police have given up their search for the so-called \"Putney Pusher\" -- a middle-aged jogger who was filmed shoving a woman pedestrian into the path of a bus on Putney Bridge.  The incident -- in May last year -- caused an outcry but, having eliminated fifty possible suspects, detectives say all lines of enquiry have been exhausted. \nPhotographs of tearful and bewildered German football fans are abundant, but sympathy's in short supply.  \"Gott im Himmel!\" crows a delighted DAILY MAIL, adding \"in Britain, there's not a dry eye in the house!!\".   \"Don't mention the score.\" quips the INDEPENDENT, channelling Basil Fawlty. The i newspaper's headline asks: \"What's the German for Schadenfreude?\"  That word also appears on the SUN's front page -- along with the English definition. The back page carries a cut-out-and-keep copy of the final group table showing Germany in last place -- to cheer readers up when they're feeling low. The TELEGRAPH admits that it's cruel to revel in the misfortune of others. But it says England's World Cup anguish at German hands is stitched in history \"like a black thread\" -- and for once all that accumulated misery switched sides.",
