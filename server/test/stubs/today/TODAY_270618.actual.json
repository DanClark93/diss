    "script": "MARTHA: Now, time for a look at today's papers and news websites.   \nThe business secretary, Greg Clarke, has been accused of sowing the seeds of panic, says THE DAILY TELEGRAPH, after urging industry leaders to use their influence to help soften Brexit.  A former Brexit minister, David Jones, complains that Cabinet ministers shouldn't be taking their lead from businesses -- rather they should be setting the policy and communicating a sense of reassurance.  \nTHE SUN reports that Theresa May will be \"hauling\" her full cabinet to Chequers to try to settle the deadlock over an EU customs deal.  The BLOOMBERG website says while the Prime Minister is facing mounting pressure to spell out her vision for Britain's future relationship with EU, she must first reach consensus with her squabbling cabinet and party.  \nTHE TIMES believes that cracks are emerging not just within the Cabinet -- but also in the EU's united front on Brexit.  It says the European Commission is hostile to Theresa May's plans to follow single market rules for parts of the economy, such as goods, because it would amount to cherry picking the rules.  But most European governments, with the exception of Germany -- reports THE TIMES -- are understood to be more pragmatic about the idea.\n'A Green Light to Criminals' is THE DAILY MAIL's response to an idea put forward by the justice minister, Rory Stewart, that prison sentences of less than a year should be scrapped -- for all but the most serious offences.  Mr Stewart believes that community orders are preferable but a former member of the Justice Committee tells THE MAIL the plan is \"idiotic\".  THE DAILY MIRROR fears that the idea is driven by cost-cutting rather than a desire to do what is best for society and victims of crime.\nLabour is considering plans to slash the number of MPs needed to nominate a leadership candidate according to THE GUARDIAN.  The proposals, to be put forward at the party conference in September, would hand new powers to members and trade unions.  A source tells the paper the change would virtually guarantee a left-wing candidate could succeed Jeremy Corbyn.\nTHE DAILY EXPRESS reports that the Duke of Cambridge was cast in the unfamiliar role of Middle East peacemaker when Israel's president asked him to take a message of hope to the Palestinian Premier.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH says it would be nice to think the Prince might have helped to advance the search for a political settlement in a troubled region.",

The Justice Secretary, David Gauke, said there should be more use of community sentences for women convicted of low-level offences.  \n A senior government minister has publicly criticised her Cabinet colleagues for introducing too many rules and regulations. In a speech last night, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury - Liz Truss - made a joke mocking the Environment Secretary, Michael Gove, for proposing a ban on wood-burning stoves. \n The president of Zimbabwe, Emmerson Mnangagwa, has told the BBC he suspects a group which supported the former First Lady, Grace Mugabe, was behind the recent attempt on his life.  Two people were killed, and dozens wounded, when a device exploded close to the President at a rally on Saturday.\n More than thirty homes have been evacuated in Stalybridge in Greater Manchester - because of a fire on nearby Saddleworth Moor. The blaze has been declared a major incident and the army is on standby to help.\n The government is being urged to change the way social care is funded in England - by introducing a new levy paid by employers and workers aged over 40. Two cross-party groups of MPs have warned that the current arrangements are unsustainable.\n A report drawn up for the BBC to mark the 70th anniversary of the creation of the NHS says the government should act more boldly to encourage people to adopt healthier lifestyles.

    "script": "MARTHA: Now, time for a look at today's papers and news websites.  \n THE TIMES accuses the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Liz Truss, of mocking her colleagues during what it describes \"a bombastic, free-wheeling speech\".  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH considers direct criticism of Michael Gove's environment policies to be a further breakdown of Cabinet discipline.  The POLITICS HOME website describes the attack by Liz Truss as \"extraordinary\" and says her comments lay bare the deep splits within Theresa May's team.  \n THE FINANCIAL TIMES is among the papers to report that two members of the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee ran up travel expenses of nearly four hundred thousand pounds in two and a half years.  The FT says the bank's governing body defended the expenses in the face of criticism from the Treasury Select Committee -- insisting while the spending had been \"staggering\" so had the contribution made by the two men. But the paper thinks the figure raises questions about the central bank's internal cost controls.  THE DAILY MAIL says the row is awkward for the Bank after years of low interest rates that have hammered savers.  \n THE GUARDIAN considers a decision by the US Supreme Court to uphold President Trump's travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries as a significant victory for the administration.  The POLITICO website says the Court \"affirmed the President's vast powers over national security matters\" at the end of a protracted legal battle. THE WASHINGTON POST and THE NEW YORK TIMES agree the ruling is a major affirmation of presidential power.  The FT labels it a \"big victory\" for Mr Trump but quotes the American Civil Liberties Union saying the ruling will go down in history as one of the Supreme Court's \"greatest failures\".   \n There's reaction to another ruling made yesterday -- which granted Uber a temporary licence to continue operating in London.  In a letter to THE TIMES, members of the parliamentary group on taxis say that the company's \"PR stunts\" haven't convinced them that Uber is \"a fit and proper operator\".  They say they don't believe that any of the tweaks to its business model have fundamentally changed how it operates.\n Most of the papers continue their celebration of the heat wave with picture of swimmers, sunbathers and general relaxation.  But THE INDEPENDENT says a level two heatwave alert issued by the Met Office means social and health care services should prepare to take action.  For the THE DAILY STAR it's a Killer Heatwave which has left three people dead.  THE DAILY EXPRESS declares that roads are melting and it's \"hell on the rails\".",
